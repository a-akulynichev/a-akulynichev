# Kasko2go Open source telematic app for Android


## _Description_
The **Kasko2go Open source** service is developed to determine a driving behaviour of a certain driver. This telematic service works with digitised road maps, has the information on static and dynamic  accident rate of different road sections.
A driver’s smartphone is used as a client telematic device. An accelerometer and a gyroscope, modules of GPS, GSM and Bluetooth systems embedded into a smartphone turn a driver’s smartphone into a source of telematic information. A mobile application installed on the smartphone transmits telematic data to servers for further processing.

## _Application Functionality:_



| Finding the “optimal route” between the start and end points of the trip  | Provides information about route safety |

<br/>

This free of charge app can be used to create your own app for Android.

## Get started

To work with the Open source project you need to receive the access to our repositories on [Github][git] that contain source codes and technical documentation of the project.
Provide our [Technical Support Service][TSS] with the information about your Github user account ([Github][git] e-mail address) and receive the following access parameters:
- USER - account username;
- PASSWORD - user account password;
- NAVIGATOR_URL - navigation service address URL. 


<br/>

## Telematic data

1. Find the `sdk-telemetry/keystore.properties` file in the form given below in the source code repository:
```
WEB_API="https://scoring-api.kasko2go.net/api/"
RECEIVER="receiver.kasko2go.net"
```

2. Add the following lines with access parameters received from out [Technical Support Service][TSS] to the end of the `sdk-telemetry/keystore.properties` file on Step 1: 

```
USER="<user_name>"
PASSWORD="<user_password>"
NAVIGATOR_URL="<https://navigation_url.host.com/>"
```


## Cartography service
1. To work with Google autocomplete service receive an **API key for the Maps SDK for Android**. The procedure for receiving the key is described in [Using API Keys][UAPIK].
Specify the received Google **API key for the Maps SDK for Android** in `sdk-telemetry/keystore.properties` file in the following form:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="<api_key>"
```

2. To work with Google maps services receive a **Google Maps API key**. The procedure for receiving the key is described in [Maps SDK for Android Quickstart][MSDK].
Specify the received Google **Maps API key** in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file in the following form:
```
 <meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="<key>" />
```



## Firebase services

Provide interaction of your Android application with Firebase services. For this add the `google-services.json` configuration file to your mobile application. Follow [this link for][FB] the procedure of adding the `google-services.json` configuration file to your mobile application. 


## Initialization Android SDK

To integrate the Open source solution SDK into your new project, you need to perform the following steps after contacting our [Technical Support Service][TSS]: 
1. Add necessary permissions <br/>
Add necessary permissions to your new project and ask a smartphone user to allow these permissions:
- Internet
- application operation in the background 
- geolocation service
- physical activity
- disabling power-saving mode
- enabling Bluetooth adapter
- you must declare a dependency to the Google Location and Activity Recognition API version 12.0.0 or higher 

```
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
   <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" />
 ```


2. Implement metadata <br/>
Metadata contains extra information about a user, a device and a vehicle:
- userId - unique identifier of the user
- deviceId - unique identifier of the device
- vehicleId - unique identifier of the vehicle
These identifiers allow to uniquely identify a user, are randomly generated by the mobile application, must be unique and have a constant value for each user and user device. If the mobile application has been reinstalled, these identifiers are generated again.  
<br/>
The identifiers userId, deviceId, vehicleId are described by the following class:

```
 class Metadata(
       userId: String,
       vehicleId: String,
       deviceId: String,
       tag: String,
       val appId: String,
       val appVersion: String,
       val mobileModel: String,
       val osVersion: String,
       val isBluetoothOn: Boolean
       )
```

3. Add speed configs <br/>
To minimise battery power consumption, in SDK you can configure parameters of the `autostart_gps_filters` filter that has the following set of parameters:
- time - periodicity of obtaining coordinates from the GPS system, time in seconds   
- distance - periodicity of obtaining coordinates from the GPS system, distance travelled in metres
- uspeed - upper threshold of vehicle speed, km/h
- dspeed - lower threshold of vehicle speed, km / h
The parameters of the `autostart_gps_filters` filter determine the periodicity with which the mobile application receives and sends GPS system data to the server for further processing. The `autostart_gps_filters` filter starts working  after trip start validation and has the logic:
- if the urrent GPS speed >= dspeed and GPS speed < uspeed and the previous filtering state differs from the current one, then apply a new filter by time = time (in seconds) and filter by distance = distance (in meters). 
- If the previous speed value was within the same limits as the current one, then do not change the filter characteristics.
The autostart_gps_filters filter with default parameter values is a variable with  JSON of the type:

```
  val configs = """
    [
    {
        "time": 18,
        "distance": 200,
        "uspeed": 70,
        "dspeed": 0
    },
    {
        "time": 18,
        "distance": 400,
        "uspeed": 110,
        "dspeed": 60
    },
    {
        "time": 18,
        "distance": 600,
        "uspeed": 150,
        "dspeed": 100
    },
    {
        "time": 18,
        "distance": 800,
        "uspeed": 190,
        "dspeed": 140
    },
    {
        "time": 18,
        "distance": 1000,
        "uspeed": 230,
        "dspeed": 180
    },
    {
        "time": 18,
        "distance": 1200,
        "uspeed": 1000,
        "dspeed": 220
    }
]
    
    """
    DetectorSdk.setSpeedConfig(context, configs)
 
```


4. Working with Bluetooth module (optional) <br/>
SDK provides an opportunity to identify the trip start moment through connecting the smartphone bluetooth module to the vehicle bluetooth. 
<br/>
To work with the smartphone bluetooth module, follow these steps:

```
   val prefs = context.getSharedPreferences(BTConnectedMonitor.BT_PREFS, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
   prefs.edit(commit = true) {
       putString(BTConnectedMonitor.BT_ADDRESS, address)
       putString(BTConnectedMonitor.BT_NAME, name)
   }
```
 
5. SDK initialisation <br/>
To initialise the SDK, follow these steps:

```
    val config = ConfigBuilder(
            host = BuildConfig.RECEIVER,
            port = BuildConfig.RECEIVER_PORT
        )
            .setStartValidationTimeout(180)
            .setStopValidationTimeout(300)
            .build()

    DetectorSdk.start(context, config, getMetadata())
 ```
