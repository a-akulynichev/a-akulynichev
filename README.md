# Kasko2go Open source telematic app for Android


## _Description_
The **Kasko2go Open source** service is developed to determine a driving behaviour of a certain driver. This telematic service works with digitised road maps, has the information on static and dynamic  accident rate of different road sections.
A driver’s smartphone is used as a client telematic device. An accelerometer and a gyroscope, modules of GPS, GSM and Bluetooth systems embedded into a smartphone turn a driver’s smartphone into a source of telematic information. A mobile application installed on the smartphone transmits telematic data to servers for further processing.

## _Application Functionality:_
