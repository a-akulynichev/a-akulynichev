A driver’s smartphone is used as a client telematic device. An accelerometer and a gyroscope, modules of GPS, GSM and Bluetooth systems embedded into a smartphone turn a driver’s smartphone into a source of telematic information. A mobile application installed on the smartphone transmits telematic data to servers for further processing.
